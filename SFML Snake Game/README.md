## Description
A modern and minimalistic implementation of the classic Snake Game using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. This project showcases basic game loop architecture, event handling, and real-time graphics rendering.

## Internal Architecture
The application is built around a classic **Game Loop** pattern governed by SFML's window events:
1. **Process Input:** Captures keyboard events (Arrow Keys, ESC) without blocking.
2. **Update State:** Updates the snake's position, checks for collisions (with walls or itself), and manages food generation/consumption. The snake is typically implemented as a `std::deque` or `std::vector` of coordinates.
3. **Render:** Clears the screen, draws the updated entities using SFML sprite/shape rendering, and swaps the display buffers.
The project is modularized into OOP concepts: `Game` (loop and state), `Snake` (movement logic), and `Food` (spawning logic).

## Features
- Classic snake gameplay: eat food, grow longer, avoid collisions
- Smooth graphics rendered with SFML
- Keyboard input for real-time control
- Score tracking and game-over condition

## Prerequisites
- C++17 or later
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`
  - macOS: `brew install sfml`
  - Windows: Download binaries from sfml-dev.org and link to your project

## How to Build and Run
1. Compile the project using g++:
   ```
   g++ -std=c++17 -o snake main.cpp Game.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./snake
   ```

## Usage / Controls
| Key         | Action            |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Arrow Keys  | Move the snake    |
| ESC         | Quit game         |
